32 Band LED Audio Spectrum Analyzer
==============

Introduction
----
Here I present you a 32 Band LED Audio Spectrum Analyzer made with a Arduino Nano and a MAX 7219 4x LED Dot matrix panel. 4 patterns were included and you can cycle through those with the push button. And the power off memory is there to keep the selected pattern in the memory when power restarts. Special thank goes to “Shajeeb” who is the original maker of this project.
